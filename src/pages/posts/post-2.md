# Starting as a computer science student at St Lawrence College..

So I started with the **Computer Programming and Analysis** course on the Kingston Campus since well.. I live in Kingston. <br>

St Lawrence College wasn't my top choice, I wanted to go to Queen's but that option was taken away from me in Highschool <br>
thanks to some discrimination around my "disability", which is a topic for another time. So I didn't have the prerequisites to study there.

## Why did I choose computer science?

**Money.**

Partially kidding... Yeah, money is a motivator, but really I like just.. making things. <br>
I think its satisfying when stuff starts working after building it up and troubleshooting it for a while. <br>
It's a great feeling and computer science just scratches that itch for me.

## So what is the taking the course like?

I just started my second semester in year 2, but so far it has its highs and lows. The professors are generally pretty good. I've had an issue <br>
with one or two but honestly it doesn't really matter as it was just a personal gripe with their teaching style. <br>

The course content is alright, personally I don't see the use in courses like Career Strategies. But things like COBOL programming and the C++ <br>
courses have been great. So far my favourite has been the GUI development with C#. But that may change as I am deeply interested in what they have <br>
in store for the game development course this semester.

The people here are great, I've made a number of friends who have the same interest in computer science as I do so working in group projects is a blast.

## Job placement..

I am slightly nervous for the Job Placement program, which is supposed to get us experience in the workforce, which is great, <br>
but ever since I started I've only ever heard conflicting information about it from the professors and from year 3 students actively in placement. <br>
The professors told us not to expect paid positions but the year 3 students tell us all positions are paid, at first we were told placement was <br>
pretty much garaunteed for us but now we are told it's about 50/50. <br>

The real thing that shivers my timbers about job placement is that I will need to quit my current job to take it. So if it isn't paid, or the <br>
hours arent enough (we are told to expect 18 hours/week), or if I don't even get a placement I may be screwed. <br>
